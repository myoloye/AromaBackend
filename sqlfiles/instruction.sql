I received several zucchinis in my bountiful basket and used most of them to make this delicious dinner. I loved making it with the yellow and green zucchinis for some added color. If you\'re in a pinch, use sour cream instead of yogurt. And if you\'re like me and had neither, I actually used cottage cheese and it worked out okay. This is a super fast and easy dinner.
